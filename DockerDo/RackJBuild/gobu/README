Windows users could run GOBU by double clicking gobuCmd.bat. In gobuCmd.bat, there
is only one command for running GOBU using Java Virtual Machine. Mac or
UN*X users could use this command to run GOBU, or try gobuCmd.sh.

NOTE: The option -Xmx2400M is a specific option of JVM for running GOBU with 2.4GB
memory, which means you should run GOBU under 64bit environment. You may change it
for larger amount of memory, but do not exceed the amount of physical memory of your
computer.
